# Optimisation Methods C++
Prescription: Nelderâ€“Mead method, Gradient method, Conjugate gradient method, Quazi-Newton method

Hi, I am student of SPbU, AMCP faculty. This is my work of Optimisation methods class.
I tested methods on two popular functions for testing - Rosenbrock and Himmelblau. You can see it on pictures.

You can use it by yourself, because it works well, all you need to change functions to which you need.
